# hierarchy-builder
High level commands to declare a hierarchy based on packed classes

# Roadmap / Milestones

1. Replicate packed classes. As of today but boilerplate generated by an Elpi program
   1. `Elpi declare_structure`
   1. test by replacing `ssralg.v`
   1. in order to not depend on Elpi use ssralg.v.in -> ssralg.v and have Elpi print the commands, rather than executing them
2. Improve the extensibility of the hierarchy by the indirection of factories. Clients are not affected by changes to the hierarchy such as adding an intermediate structure
   1. `Elpi declare_factory`
3. Improve performance flattening
   1. no more base + new_mixin, but rather mixin_1 + ... + mixin_n + new_mixin, painful to do by hand, but easy if you are metaprogramming
